Things that failed or to improve in next version. 

- Water floaters getting accidentally stuck with other cables/tubes. 
- Water flowing back to source slowly (even with one way valve). 
- Air bubbles getting pumps stuck/unable to pump water. 
- Getting water in needs a big revamp. 
- Organize cables better, should not be visible. 
- Sediment stays at the bottom, when we refill it disturbs it and the PPM shoots through the roof.
